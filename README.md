# Battery API 
### DESCRIPTION 
This lab uses the Battery API to retrieve real-time battery information from the user's device. 
It then integrates with the RoboHash third-party API to generate a unique robot image based on the current battery percentage. 
The image is dynamically updated and displayed on the page as the battery level changes.
